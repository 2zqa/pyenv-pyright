# pyenv-pyright

pyenv-pyright is a [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) plugin to help setup [Microsoft Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) LSP Server to use
virtualenv for local projects. This plugin helps to create or update `venvPath` and `venv`
attributes in pyright config file `pyrightconfig.json` to pyenv virtualenvs.

This plugin may come in handy when working with pyright in [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) while using pyenv to manage
your virtualenvs, since pyright doesn't uses pyenv set with `pyenv local`, a good way to overcome
this problem is to explicitly set the desired venv in pyright config file `pyrightconfig.json`.
So with this plugin you can do this with only one command:

```
pyenv pyright
```

## Requirements

* pyenv
* jq (available in all major distro repositories like Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux)

## Installation

This will install the latest development version of `pyenv-pyright` into the `$(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-pyright` directory.

**Important note:** If you installed pyenv into a non-standard directory, make sure that you clone this repo into the 'plugins' directory of wherever you installed into.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/alefpereira/pyenv-pyright.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-pyright
```

## Usage

- From an activated pyenv virtualenv (set by `pyenv local`
for example) run `pyenv pyright` to set pyright config file
to this venv:

```
 (myvenv) pyenv pyright
```

- Considering you have a pyenv virtualenv named `myvenv`,
to set pyright config file to use this virtualenv,
pass it as argument:

```
 pyenv pyright myvenv
```

**Note:** It works only for virtualenvs, it doesn't work for python
instalations, for example `pyenv pyright 3.10.0` won't work.

- Command help:

```
pyenv pyright --help

Usage: pyenv pyright [virtualenv]
       pyenv pyright --help

       [virtualenv] should be a Python version known to pyenv.
```

## Additional Notes

### Update existing `pyrightconfig.json` file:

This script creates pyright LSP server config file `pyrightconfig.json`
in the current directory, setting its `venv` attribute to
selected virtualenv and `venvPath` to `PYENV_ROOT/versions`.
If `pyrightconfig.json` file already exists, the script will update those
attributes in the existing file instead.

### Uses [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) for venv management and command completions:

The pyenv-pyright plugin **supports only virtualenvs known to pyenv**,
and pyenv-virtualenv is the way to go for venv management in pyenv.
This plugin requires pyenv-virtualenv not only for the venvs but also
for command completions.

If your workflow don't involve using venvs or you don't use pyenv-virtualenv,
pyenv-pyright plugin may not have any use for you. But if you use venvs,
and use pyenv to manage python versions, you probably use pyenv-virtualenv
to manage venvs. If you installed pyenv using its installing tool
[pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) you already have
pyenv-virtualenv (if you are not sure check by running `pyenv virtualenvs`),
in case you don't have it installed yet, install it using the guide in 
[pyenv-virtualenv installing section](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv#installing-as-a-pyenv-plugin)
or with the pyenv-installer tool.
